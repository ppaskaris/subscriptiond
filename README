subscriptiond
=============

subscriptiond is an anonymous subscription manager for YouTube [1]. It is free
software, distributed under the GNU General Public License [2].

I wrote this software to learn ASP.NET Core MVC and to scratch my own itch
around managing YouTube subscriptions. I run an instance [3] on the Azure free
tier for my personal use. You may to use this instance if you wish, but I ask
that you be considerate as it is grossly under-provisioned for general use.
