subscriptiond
=============

subscriptiond is an anonymous subscription manager for YouTube [1]. It is free
software [2], distributed under the GNU General Public License [3].

I wrote this program to learn ASP.NET Core MVC and to scratch my own itch around
managing YouTube subscriptions. I run an instance [4] on the Azure free tier for
my personal use. You are free to use this instance, but be warned that Azure
suspends the application when it is not in use, which limits the usefulness of
the program.
